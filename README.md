## Who

Autonomous Robotics A Block: Connor, Asher, Hannah

## What

We accomplished making a small button pressing game.

## How

We used the micro:bit capabilities of an array of 5 by 5 leds and the two A and B buttons. Our code uses a while loop to continously check the values of each button and change a varible score based of of their state. We used custom images that displayed either button A or button B as the current winner.

## Why

We made the design choices we made because we were focused on creating a robust program that would not fail. We wanted to make a fun game and desgined our code off of that goal.
